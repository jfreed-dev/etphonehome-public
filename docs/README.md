# ET Phone Home Docs

## Brand assets

All project graphics live in `docs/assets/etphonehome/`:

- `docs/assets/etphonehome/logos/` - primary logo and wordmark
- `docs/assets/etphonehome/icons/` - UI icons (server, client, tunnel, webhook, security)
- `docs/assets/etphonehome/banners/` - hero/banner art
- `docs/assets/etphonehome/ui/` - starter UI theme tokens (`theme.css`)

Use the SVGs directly in the docs and web UI for crisp scaling.
